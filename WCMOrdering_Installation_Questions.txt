I developed window service application called WCMOrdering.
 I install it on my development laptop to runs under local account.
 Its been tested and works as expected.

Now I need to install it on one of the WCM servers and make sure it will have permissions to
  - read/write on SBS server file system 
  - read/write data on dairy_sales database located on SQL server
  - send Emails (SMPT) - external and internal using Exchange server 
  - write to windows log

Could you please advice what server is better to install it on and assist on installation and testing.

Also I require assistance in installing and configuring 3rd party OpenAS2 Server Application which will be transmitting messages (files) between WCM and Elior - I've got software and documentation downloaded as advised by Elior technical team member.
